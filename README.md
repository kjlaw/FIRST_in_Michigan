FIRST in Michigan
=================

This is an archive of the FIRST in Michigan website. (July 2014)

FIRST in Michigan is a non-profit organization that oversees all the FIRST robotics competitions in Michigan. I started working on this website in 2010, adding new components and features over the years. Working closely with the board of directors, I designed the FIRST in Michigan logo based on the US FIRST logo. The color scheme of this website also follows the US FIRST color scheme. This website contains information for all levels of robotics competition, from Kindergarteners building LEGO robots to high school students building robots weighing over 100 pounds. This website displays all the events in Michigan and information relating to these events. It also has an interactive map that displays all the FIRST robotics teams in Michigan.
